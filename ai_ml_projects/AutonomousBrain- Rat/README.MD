# Independent project

Probably my first AI based project when I became first interested in AI during the final days of my undergraduate course.

This is a simplified implementation of autonomous goal based agents interacting within a 2D descretized world by sensing the immediate surroundings and being able to move and perform a limited set of actions guided by goals which depend on their internal state such as hunger.

The agents implemented here is a rat and a snake in 2D world. The code is in Java circa 2013.
