# Hi!

This repository archives the sources of many projects big and small done by me.

## Declaration

***This is not an exhaustative list of codes I've done as there were many (now I realize!) quiet useful pieces of work that I created but didn't bother enough to archive.
I try to archive in the master branch only codes that work as advertised. Though I do not take responsibility nor give any guarantees regarding the robustness or correctness of any code. Everything works as I last checked.
Each and every character in every source belongs to me.
Ask permission before use (if you feel like it!) or cite me. :)
Enjoy!***
