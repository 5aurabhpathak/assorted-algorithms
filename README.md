#Hi!

This repository archives the sources of many projects big and small done by me.

##Index

* src/
 * c/ - standalone C99 codes related to data structures and algorithms.
 * shell/ - various shell scripts useful for automating an awesome linux system (like mine!) and accomplishing various tasks.
 * java/ - some small machine learning projects and my bachelor's final year project (the big one!). Java 7 and 8.
   * *Autonomous Rat brain* - a trivial desire based AI brain.
   * *iris22* - supervised as well as unsupervised machine learning algorithms for classification using the well known iris dataset. All combined in a single project class hierarchy.
   * **Magic for English** - My final year project on Genetic algorithms and natural language processing. Done at Galgotias (2013-14) under supervision of Mr. Manish Kumar Singh.
   * cpp/ - accepted C++11 competitive programming codes on various coding platforms.
 * python/ - mostly machine learning codes + utilities. Everything python 3.x.
   * *dp* - dynamic programming
   * *hackerrank* - python code for two of the problems on hackerrank week of code 24. (Other w24 codes were in C++ and in hence in cpp/). got a ***gold medal*** in that one!
   * *ivp* - Image Processing (done as part of pg course)
   * *nlp* - contains codes in Natural Language Processing taken as a pg course.
     * **Mtech thesis** - Master's thesis is on Machine Translation of hindi to english. Ongoing...
   * *soc* - Machine learning codes (done as part of Sof Computing course in pg)

##Declaration

***This is not the exhaustative list of codes I've done as there were many (now I realize!) quiet useful pieces of work that I created but didn't bother enough to archive.
I try to archive in the master branch only codes that work as advertised. Though I do not take responsibility nor give any guaranties regarding the robustness or correctness of any code. Everything works as I last checked.
Each and every character in every source belongs to me.
Ask permission before use (if you feel like it!) or cite me. :)
Enjoy!***
