# Algorithms and data structures from scratch in pure C99

Most of the code here is done as part of AAP (Algorithm Analysis and Programming) coursework during masters. Some other code such as ttyecho.c was written as part of customization of my linux system.

All the code here is guaranteed to compile in gcc.
